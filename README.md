# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/). Written in Java with the goal to only use plain
Java (no external libraries) to learn more of the possibilities and limitations of the newer Java versions. 

I also try to create readable code, so I am not pursuing to create oneliner solutions. And due to time constraints 
many of the solutions are not refactored to what I really would like them to be. But hey, I am at least learning 
a few things here and having some fun while doing that :-).

If you have any tips or comments, feel free to raise an issue!
